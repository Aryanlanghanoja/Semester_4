Q.1 List the basic registers used for timers in AVR ATMEGA32 along with their uses.
Q.2 Determine the timer's clock frequency and its period for various AVR based systems, with below mentioned crystal frequencies. Assume that no prescalar is used. 1. 10MHz 2. 8MHz 3. 1MHz
Q.3 Write a program to generate a square wave with a period of 12.5us on pin PORTB.3. Assume that XTAL = 8MHz.
Q.4 Write a C program to toggle all the bits of PORTB continuously with a delay of 10ms. Use Timer 0, normal mode, with suitable prescalar to generate the delay. Assume the frequency to be 8MHz
Q.5 Write a C program to toggle only PORTB.4 bit continuously every 70us. Use Timer 0,, Normal Mode, and 1:8 prescalar to create the delay. Assume XTAL= 8MHz.
