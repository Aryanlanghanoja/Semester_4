Filter Method:

Advantages:

Bandwidth Efficiency: The filter method efficiently uses the available bandwidth by transmitting only one sideband along with the carrier.
Reduced Adjacent Channel Interference: Since only one sideband is transmitted, the potential for adjacent channel interference is reduced compared to double-sideband modulation.
Power Efficiency: It is more power-efficient than DSB-FC modulation since it does not transmit the redundant carrier.

Limitations:

Complexity: Implementing the filter method requires precise filters to suppress one sideband effectively, which can add complexity to both the transmitter and receiver.
Frequency Selectivity: The filter method requires careful tuning and adjustment of the filters to maintain signal integrity, especially in the presence of frequency drift or variations.

Phasing Method:

Advantages:

Bandwidth Efficiency: Similar to the filter method, the phasing method also achieves bandwidth efficiency by transmitting only one sideband.
Reduced Complexity: The phasing method can be implemented with simpler circuitry compared to the filter method, making it more practical in some applications.

Frequency and Phase Alignment: Proper frequency and phase alignment between the modulating signal and the carrier are critical for successful demodulation, which can be challenging to achieve in some scenarios.
Sensitive to Phase Imbalance: Any phase imbalance or error in the modulation process can degrade signal quality and introduce distortion.
Complex Demodulation: Demodulation in the phasing method typically requires coherent detection, which can add complexity to the receiver design.

Third Method (commonly refers to the Weaver's or Hilbert transform method):

Advantages:

Simple Implementation: The third method offers a relatively simple implementation compared to traditional filter or phasing methods.
Reduced Complexity: It simplifies the process of generating SSB signals by using a Hilbert transform or a Weaver modulator, reducing the need for complex filters or mixers.
Improved Signal Quality: By maintaining better frequency and phase relationships, the third method can often yield improved signal quality.

Limitations:

Sensitivity to Timing and Phase Errors: Like other SSB generation methods, the third method is sensitive to timing and phase errors, which can degrade signal quality if not properly compensated for.


VSB Modulation Applications
The applications of VSB modulation include the following.

- VSB modulation is standard for the transmission of TV signals. Because the video signals require a large transmission BW using the techniques like DSB-FC otherwise DSF-SC.
- This is a type amplitude modulation that is mainly used for the TV broadcast worldwide. In this broadcast, it is essential to broadcast the information of video and audio concurrently.
- In the transmission of VSB, the higher sideband of video signal & picture carrier are broadcasted without any control. Where a vestige is a fraction of lower sideband and it is transmitted & the residual part is covered up
- When the usage of BW is considered, then this is the most suitable and proficient technique.
